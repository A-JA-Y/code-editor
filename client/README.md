### Backend (Server)
- Node.js and Express.js based RESTful API
- Implements robust error handling middleware
- Follows industry-standard security practices
- Structured with a modular architecture for maintainability

### Key Features
- Modern development tooling and build optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Production-ready configuration
- Clean and maintainable codebase structure

### Development Setup
The project uses Vite as the build tool, offering:
- Lightning-fast cold starts
- Instant hot module replacement (HMR)
